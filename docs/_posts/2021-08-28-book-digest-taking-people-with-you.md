> **Author:** David Novak, Chairman & CEO of Yum! Brands<br>
> **Published:** 2012 by Porfolio/Penguin<br>
> **Notes:** The following are short summary of the contents of the book, containing key points to each of the chapter. I find this book highly relevant, useful and relatable to my own experience.

### Part 1: Get your mindset right
#### Chapter 2: Be your best self
1. Extraordinary authenticity
  * Rather than change oneself, consider finding ways to adapt that feel natural and comfortable.
  * E.g. CEO of PepsiCo, Indra Nooyi, found ways to adapt by connecting her lifelong love of cricket with baseball and local team - the New York Yankee.
2. Know yourself
  * Crucial for every great leader to know who they are and where they've been; your values and your goals.
  * Putting a lifeline to remind of:
    * where one has been
    * what one has learned
    * what lessons have not come easily (who and what have helped one learn)

3. Lifeline exercise:
  * Include personal and career events that have affected you in some way
  * Consider:
       * key events (graduation, marriage, deaths, job chances, etc.)
       * other experiences (victories achieved, crises endured, fears overcome, stands taken, lessons learned)
       * place points above and below correspond to emotions intensity
       * add supplementary notes to make more connections/ personal
       * look back and probe deeper:
          * what experiences have most affected the way you lead today?
          * who were the people who have had the greatest impact?
          * what qualities do you admire most? 
          * what steps to take to model after them while being true to yourself?
4. Grow yourself - self-awareness and authenticity
  * 3-by-5 index card short answers to two questions:
       * What am I today?
       * How can I be even better tomorrow?
  * Example from David's 2011:
       * Passionate/convicted -> Don't overwhelm/ intimidate others
       * Creative -> Stay focused until job is done
       * Instintive -> Balance with facts/ process and discipline
       * Driven for results -> Instill even more urgency: so what/ now what!!!
       * Striving for balance -> More time at home/ stay in shape
5. Be your own masterpiece: be your best self
  * Warren Buffet - look for company that are run by painters who are working on painting that isn't finished yet
  * Always work in progress!
6. How to be yourself
  * Have conviction
  * Know your stuff - no substitute for time & experience
  * Know your environment - compatible and not ignoring the impact you're having on people around you
  * Build self-awareness - solicit feedback on how you're impacting others, ask what they'd do if they were in your position
  * Be open and honest about what you don't know - builds trust and gives others opportunity to contribute
  * Use positive self-talk & positive thoughts
  * Get out of comfort zone
  * Team together team apart - to handle disagreement incl. superiors; when with team, have courage to express your view points (team together), if superior decided to go different route, support that decision given the prior (team apart)
7. Help others be themselves
  * Believe in all people - celebrate individuality, aim for same goal and value system (unity in values, diversity of styles)
  * Provide individual development plans - tailored constructive feedback
  * Create safe haven - make it easy for folks to speak up, allow people to disagree, and when they do, thank them!
  * Openly seek knowledge & perspective of others

#### Chapter 3: Be an avid learner
* Mindset check - "As the leader, I know the most" vs. "There is always more to learn, and everyone I meet knows something I don't"
* Borrow ideas from others, incl. competitors vs. reinvent the wheel
* 5 Dynasty Drivers to make an enduringly great company:
  1. A culture where everyone makes a difference
  2. Customer and sales mania - do whatever it takes to build customer loyalty; owner mindset
  3. Competitive brand differentiation - e.g. Target on concept exaggerating the differences with aisles bigger than others
  4. Continuity in people and process - put process and discipline around what mattered most to their business
  5. Consistency in results
* Commitment to learning and be a know-how junkie, with 4 tactics to achieving good outcome:
  1. Eliminate "not invented here" or unwillingness to adopt something not originated by you. Here's some useful tactics to consider:
     1. Model the behavior by being a know-how junkie yourself
        * Apple - "addition by subtraction", less is more
        * Yum! iChing - system for sharing knowledge
     2. Actively listen to and learn from others
     3. Create a culture of healthy debate/ healthy decision - establish safe environment for sharing/ disagreement without fear
     4. Celebrate using someone else's idea
        * "Look, this is Steve's idea and I think it's a great idea" vs. "I've got a great idea"
     5. Share what you know     
  2. Act like you own the place
  3. Keep your big goal top-of-mind - strategic about too much information, stay focused
  4. Seek out knowledge holders and sources - proactive in gaining knowledge by searching for expertise. tell them you'd like to learn from them

#### Chapter 4: Unleash the power of people
* Leadership is a priviledge. All people, when given a choice, have an inherent desire to do the right thing, contribute, and make positive difference. As a leader, it's mmy job to surface and unleash potential in every person.
  * David reached out to franchisees, asked what they would do if they were in charge:
    * Crispy Strips originated from franchisee down in Arkansas, saw sale boosted by 9%
    * Chicken Pot Pie originated from Chef Council composed of franchisees who had a passion for making great food
* Mindset check: "Give people an inch, and the'll take a mile" vs. "Believe in people, and they'll believe in you in return"
* What happens when you put your faith in people:
  * They do things even they didn't know they could
    * Honeywell, prevented factory shutdown by getting everyone who might be able to help in a room, and in 24-hour, an answer as to how to ensure shutdown does happen; turn impossible to even better solution given the stretched challenge
  * They become more invested in their work
    * Give employees that handle customer discretionary fund to satisfy customer without getting anyone's permission first
      * Ken Blanchard written a book on this topic called "Customer Mania: It's Never Too Late to Build a Customer-Focused Company", published in 2004
  * They rise to the occasion
* Establishing Trust with Your Team
  1. Know that people want to contribute - starts with the right attitude, believing and trusting people
  2. Demonstrate that everyone counts
  3. The more they know, the more they care
  4. Ask question that promote insight
     * What would you do if you had my job?
     * Going two deep, i.e. not just boss, but boss' boss, and similarly, direct reports and their corresponding reports. Show them you care by asking them what they think and getting to know them better
     * Exercise: get to know people:
       1. Tell me something you think I don't know about you
       2. Tell me something you like about me
       3. Tell me something you think we have in common
       4. Give partner chance to ask you the same 3 questions
       5. Do 3 rounds of this, both of you would struggle but being intentional about response really makes a difference
     * Tool: trust model, Trust = (C + R + O)/S
       1. (C)redible (trust builder)
          * Do you tell the truth?
          * When you don't know, do you say you don't know?
       2. (R)eliable in your actions (trust builder)
          * Do you deliver on commitments?
          * Do you commit only to things that you plan to folllow through on?
       3. (O)pen to other points of view (trust builder)
          * Do you actively seek input from others?
          * Do you show people how you've acted on their input?
       4. (S)elf-orientation (trust destroyer)
          * To what degree is the focus on you versus others?
  5. Take responsive action - act on the knowledge and show that their feedback is taken into account
* Triumph of the human spirit
  * Trust people, do not micromanage and allow people to make their own decisions
  * Be intentional, e.g. during financial crisis, JP Morgan's Jamie Dimon introduced accelerated management whereby he held 3-a-day-meeting where anyone is who knows the facts and who can impart them quickly can attend and be part of the change
* Let others hold you accountable - if something I said/ done is ridiculous, I want to know

#### Chapter 5: You have to believe it can be done
* Seeing success
  * Believing you can succeed is not the same as knowing exactly how you're going to get there
  * More important to believe you and your team has capacity to figure things out
* Prepare your mind to win, to cultivate that belief, here are some tactics:
  * Consider the alternatives (there isn't any to allow options to fail)
  * Search out for inspiration
* Be intentional about belief - can do mindset
* Communicate your belief and sing it loud
* Know why you believe

### Part 2: Have a plan

| Theme | Description |
| ----- | ----------- | 
| Strategy | With your team, you need to clearly idetify where you're going and what you want to get done |
| Structure | You need to reinforce your strategy by putting the right resources and processes in place so your people can help you execute your plan |
| Culture | You have to create an environment that reinforces the strategy and structure by engaging your people and encouraging the behaviors you wanted |

#### Chapter 6: strategy: tell it like it is...and how it could be 
* See the world the way it really is, not the way you wish it would be
  * Defining reality is relatively easy in environment you've got issues and problems, but is harder in an environment where business is doing wells
  * It's liberating for the organization when leader is defining reality, because often people think that those subjects are taboo
* Reality Plus
  * Starts by getting everyone on the same page, but you can't stop there
  * Define reality while also showing people where that reality can take them; goes hand-in-hand with creating hope
* What is "Reality"?
  * Customer reality
  * Team reality
    * What's working, what's not? What would you do if you were me? Encourage healthy debate
  * Competitive reality
  * Financial reality
* Creating hope
  * Goldman Sachs' 10 characteristics of high-performing company:
    1. High-quality product/ service and sustainable competitive advantage
    2. Superior management with demonstrated desire to act in shareholders' interests
    3. Compound earnings growth rate of 10-12% over last 10 years
    4. Consistency/ predictability/quality of reported earnings
    5. Projected growth in earning power of at least 10% over 3 years
    6. A strong balance sheet
    7. High profitability
    8. Generation of free cash flow
    9. International competitiveness
    10. Reasonable purchase price
* Telling isn't selling
  * Define reality in emotional way that create a clear case for change and hope for future, but realize that people are bestwon over when they draw their own conclusions
  * No situation in business is hopeless. If you're breathing and you can get up in the morning, you've got a chance
* Constantly identify the unfinished business
  * Identfiy work your team still needs to do to get to where you want to go - What's next? Where do we go from here? What's our unfinished business?

#### Chapter 7: create a vision and personalize it
* Create a visioon that people can look and say;
  1. I understand it
  2. I know that my customers, or the people we need to win over, will like it
  3. I can get excited about it.
  4. I can make it happen. 
* Future back
  1. Visualize what the future will look like when you have achieved your goal
  2. Identify the actions you must take to reach that future vision
  3. Decide what has to be accomplished, each day/ week to drive to completion
* Create a noble cause

  | Company   | Cause |
  | --------- | ----- |
  | Google    | To organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful |
  | Walmart   | To give ordinary folks the chance to buy the same things as rich people |
  | Disney    | To make people happy |
  | Starbucks | To inspire and nurture the human spirit, one person, one cup, and one neighborhood at a time |
  | Yum!      | To be the defining global company that feeds the world |

* Power language
* Personalize the vision
* If it's not simple, start over (simple to remember!)

#### Chapter 8: strategy: gain alignment every step of the way at every level
* Gaining alignment is the key to ownership and accountability
* Beware of slow-nos
  * People who do not like conflicts and may not voice their concerns, but neverthenless, down the track, can kill your initiative
    * If these individuals are important to move your goal forward, ask them directly:
      * Are you onboard?
      * Have I satisfied your concerns?
    * Knowing your people and how they think comes in:
      * Someone in the room who usually against price increases and price increase is part of your plan:
        * Hey, I know you hate price increases. What do you think about this?
      * Know finance guy that usually quibbles oer numbers but today unusually quiet, call him out and get him to declare publicly exactly what he thinks
* Steps toward gaining alignment
  1. Share the reality. Help people understand the why
  2. Ask for input. Show that you have listened
  3. No involvement equals no commitment
* Productive conflict
  * Teams that engage in productive conflict know that the only purpose is to produce the best possible solution in the shortest amount of time
  * Be intentional, force alignment/ commitment:
    * Are we going to do this?
    * When is it going to happen?
  * As a leader, make sure you manage debate
    * While avoiding conflict is bad, conflict that degenerates into pointless or hurtful argument is worse for morale
    * Bring people focus back to the fact that the purpose is to debate and _solve_
    * Willingness to get things out in the open and take on the fight will differentiate you as a leader
  * Encourage productive conflict:
    1. What do you appreciate about what you just heard?
    2. How could you make it even better?
  * Cascade your alignment
  * Make gaining alignment personal:
    1. What do you want them to do?
    2. What's in it for them?
    3. Are you going to do it too?
  * Exercise, seek out leaders/ mentors, ask them:
    * What feeds resistence from others, and how they turn them around?
    * What practices do you use to surface and manage misalignment with your team?

#### Chapter 9: structure: resources, organization, and process enable execution
* People resources: building the right team
  1. The team has good chemistry together
  2. Represented the skills we needed to move forward
  3. Complemented me really well
* Inspire, create growth environment and invest in their people
* Understand and motivate your team
  1. Ask questions that promote insights
     * What's working, what's not, what would you do if you were me?
  2. Listen for understanding
  3. Take note of differences in style
* Organize your resources
  * Dangerous when articulate a goal/ vision but then not put resources to achieve it:
    1. A lack of resources put toward a goal gives people permission not to focus on it
    2. Next time you have a goall you want to accomplish, your people may wonder if you're just crying wolf
  * Here are some examples of how you might need to organize your resources:
    * Create new roles (incl. external leadership hire)
    * Define roles more clearly
    * Centralize resources
    * Make financial investment - CEO/ leader need to be the catalyst on resources (don't wait for everybody to do bottoms-up budgeting, it will be too slow if you need to move faster)
* Put process and discipline around what matters
  * E.g. Las Vegas casinos, slot machines continue to function even when there is electricity blackouts
  * Singapore Airlines - flight attendants are core to their business, developed intricate hiring process to hire the right people
  * Target - Marketers spend 65% of their time communicating to their own employees about what the brand stands for
  * Procter & Gamble - developed an entire religion around the power of innovation
* Use the "Hit by a Bus" standard
  * If you were to be hit by a bass tomorrow, would your team or organization be able to go on without you

#### Chapter 10: culture: make "winning together" a big idea
* Culture is no accident
  * Needs to be built deliberately, everyone's job to create a positive culture and make it a big idea; it's the leader's job to ensure everyone understands that and believes in it
  * Here are some ways to make your culture come to live:
    * Create shared experiences (e.g. training to create shared experience through same training, shared knowledge as everyone learns same material and shared language as everyone understands and uses the terms from the program; periodic town hall meetings as open forums for Q&A and discussions)
    * Keep creating new memories - leader's job to ensure those memorable moments (e.g. recognition, team events, etc.) happen
    * Cast the right shadow - no culture takes root unless the leader owns it first, so mean what you say and set the stage
    * Choose the right people - find people who has a predisposition to your culture/ values and they bring it out in them
    * Make culture hero -
