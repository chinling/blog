> I am an avid data practitioner, having 15+ years of experience leading successful data initiatives across many different environments, from start-ups to well-established organizations going through a transformative journey. I am a lifetime learner and technologist at heart, always keen to learn and find a new approach to solving a business problem and unlock value creation. I am a firm believer in servant leadership, and I find tremendous joy in building and growing teams, building products, and dabbling with new technologies. I still write code in my free time and enjoy reading management and leadership books.
